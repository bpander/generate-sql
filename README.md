# SQL Transpiler

This is my submission for the longform programming problem described at https://gist.github.com/perivamsi/1cbea6e3874ba5638cd58202d7dcb1f7

The `generateSql` function lives in [app/lib/generateSql.ts](app/lib/generateSql.ts).

Tests can be found in [app/lib/generateSql.test.ts](app/lib/generateSql.test.ts).

It should work with any recent version of node. Once you run `npm i`, you can run the tests with `npm test`.

Thanks!
